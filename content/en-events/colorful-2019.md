The activities of the Civic Museum of Nepi continue with a photographic exhibition organized in collaboration with the Cultural Association **"Terramare"**. The exhibition will be held from Thursday 27 June and will be open until Sunday 7 July.

During these days there will be differen initiatives, including a **photographic walk**, on Sunday 30 June, along the historic center of Nepi and, on 29 June and 6 July, **two guided tours** of the Civic Museum, the Catacomb of Santa Savinilla, the Borgia's Castle and the Necropolis of "Tre Ponti".

The knowledge of Nepi's cultural heritage will also be accompanied by environmental care. In fact, the opening of the exhibition will also be an opportunity to talk about the **plastic free** theme; that is to say the limitation or rather the renunciation of the use of single-use plastic material (bottles, plates, etc.), whose inconsiderate dispersion is causing significant damage to the marine ecosystem, in particular.

Ennio La Malfa, national secretary of the Kronos Onlus Academy, Rita Vergini and Massimo Petrella of "SalvaguardiAmo Bracciano" association will deal with this important problem.
