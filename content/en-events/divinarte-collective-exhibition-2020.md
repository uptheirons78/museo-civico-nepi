With a look at the beauties of our past the Cultural Association **"AmorArte"** inaugurates the new year with a collective of contemporary art inside the Museo Civico di Nepi (VT) which can be visited from 13 January to 26 January 2020.

On this occasion, on Sunday 12th at 5.15 pm, as usual, the **DiVinArte 2019 catalog** will be presented to all the artists who participated in the last September event dedicated to the 500th anniversary of Leonardo da Vinci.

Everything will be accompanied by a **wine tasting** by the sommelier Maurizio Giovannetti of the Enoteca Gustopi√π.

An opportunity not to be missed to be able to admire both the works of the artists and everything inside the Civic Museum of Nepi.
