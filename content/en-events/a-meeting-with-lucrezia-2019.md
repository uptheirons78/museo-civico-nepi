On Saturday 5 October the exhibition **"A Meeting with Lucrezia"** will be held at the premises of the Museo Civico di Nepi. The actors EBE Koinè, from "Nuova Torretta" and Annarita Salerno will interpret a selection of lectures taken from **"The Pope's Daughter"**, a novel by **Dario Fo** dedicated to the figure of **Lucrezia Borgia**.

Among the many works that, in recent years, have described the figure of Lucrezia, the one from Dario Fo is perhaps the most unique; the result of historical research and the sensitivity of a great writer. The novel paints a dark portrait of the society of the time which ends up enhancing **Lucrezia's fragility and humanity**.

As the Master writes: _"Of course if we detach the story of Pope Alexander VI **and his relatives from the Italian Renaissance**, we get a shocking saga, where the characters move with no respect for their opponents and often in their own same comparisons. The victim to sacrifice every time, since his childhood, is certainly Lucrezia. It is she who is thrown both by her father and by her brother on every occasion into the whirlpool of financial and political interests, without a modicum of pity. What do you think the sweet daughter does not worry at all"_.

Despite the great suffering suffered, the last period of life spent in Ferrara will do justice to Lucrezia. Appreciated governor, **_"the kind duchess"_** will be characterized by her religious fervor that will lead her to found the Monastery of S. Bernardino.

The choreography and organization of the event will be done by Ornella Marcucci.
