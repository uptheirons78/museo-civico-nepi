The church is **dedicated to the Saints Vito and Modesto**, it is built with a single little hall, it is traditionally considered **one of the oldest religious building in Nepi**. Old documents testify it was built probably in the **second half of th 15th century**, but the old and original structure and the oldest frescos inside it, still visible today, gave us the possibility to **date it in the 12th century**. In the second half of the 15th century the roof tiles were taken and used to cover the Cathedral roof. The church remained without a roof for almost a century. This state of abandon brought the structure to a slow decay and it was also proposed to destroy it

Alla seconda metà del XVI risalgono lavori di restauro che portarono anche al rifacimento dell’apparato decorativo. A questa fase sono databili **due affreschi** raffiguranti _**San Luca Evangelista**_  e la _**Madonna con Bambino**_  _**con i**_  _**Santi Vito e Modesto**_.

It was renovated in the **second half of the 16th century** and also new decorations were made. It is possible to date in those days 2 important frescos still visible inside the church. One is about **Saint Luke The Evangelist** and the other one **Virgin Mary with the Saints Vito and Modesto**.

This last one took the place of a previous deteriorated fresco which, together with a painting of the **Crucifixion**, is the only decoration that remains today of the original structure.
