The Saint Silvestro church dates back to the **15th century**. The building that can be seen today is, however, the result of the renovation works commissioned by the duke **_Fabrizio Orsini_** at the beginning of the 17th century. The church was enlarged and its entrance was moved to the north side. In fact, the structure originally had its entrance to the east along the current Via del Carmine.

It was built for the **_Benedettine Silvestrini monks_** who occupied the nearby convent and named after Saint Silvestro. It is also called _**Chiesa del Carmine**_ because, before the Silvestrini monks, the convent housed **Carmelite nuns**, therefore devoted to the **Madonna del Carmelo** (_Carmelus Holy Mary_) whose statue is still placed behind the main altar.

The facade underwent a further renovation at the beginning of the 18th century by the **_Count Francesco Cerbelli_**, whose noble coat of arms is located above the entrance arch.

Inside, the church has **a single hall, with six side chapels**. Some of these are certainly dating back to the 18th century. The most valuable paintings are a representation of **_Sanâ€™Antonio Abate_** and one of **_San Biagio_**, from the church of the same name.

Since 1951 the building has undergone major restorations that have affected both the internal and external parts.
