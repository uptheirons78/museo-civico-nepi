This church is among the oldest of Nepi. It is possible to date in the **10th century** the original structure. Only few traces remains now of this first building because of the several renovations during the centuries.

The most evident renovations took place in the 12th and 18th century. In the 12th century the apse was built and still now it is possible to see it. In the 18th century two lateral chapels were built giving the church the actual structure with a **greek cross plant**.

Nel XV secolo, accanto alla chiesa, fu costruito un ospedale affidato alla _**Confraternita della Disciplina**_ poi _**del Gonfalone**_.

In the 15th century a hospital was built beside the church and managed by the **Discipline's Confraternity**, then by the **Gonfalone's Confraternity**.

Unfortunately during the 20th century the church has constantly degraded. In 1970 the roof partially collapsed and in 1980 the roof of central nave collapsed.

Today the church is abandoned with scaffolding covering partially the lacking roof.
