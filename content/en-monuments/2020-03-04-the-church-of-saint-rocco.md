The church of Saint Rocco is, most likely, identified with the building built in honor of Saint Rocco following a **plague epidemic that broke out in Nepi in 1467**. The structure has a **simple facade**, with no decorations also due to subsequent renovations.

It is structured with a **single hall**, probably greater in origin, and **with a side chapel** where, inside a lunette, it is possible to see **a fresco representing the saint that could be dated at the end of the 15th century**.

The painting consists of a central square, occupied by the figure of Saint Rocco, and four side panels that illustrate important moments in his life.

The saint is depicted in a **pilgrim's suit**, with a hat, saddlebag and stick, and his left hand indicating the wound on his uncovered thigh. The commissioner of the fresco, a notable representative of the Nepi community, knelt in front of him.

The last box below depicts **the death of Saint Rocco** who died of hardship in prison after being arrested on charges of espionage, not wanting to reveal his identity. Two angels accompany his soul to heaven. A writing recalls that **anyone who commends himself to him with sincere devotion will be freed from the plague**.

As **protector of pestilences** his cult spread throughout Western Europe starting in the second half of the 14th century.
