Entering the city of Nepi, beside the Farnesian Walls, it is possible to see this large aqueduct with **two orders of arches**. Even though it looks like an old roman aqueduct, it was built in the **16th century** and works ended only in **1727**.

The visible part of the aqueduct is **285 meters long** and it is composed of 36 arches, with a maximum height of almost 20 meters. For many years the town needed a direct water supply inside the walls. Before the realization of the aqueduct, the water was collected in two cisterns collecting rain water, whose presence is documented since roman age, or from the near rivers called _Rio Puzzolo_ and _Rio Falisco_.

In **1559** researches for springs that could supply the town began. One spring was individuated nearby a place called _Varano_, some kilometers north-West from Nepi.

The most part of the aqueduct layout runs underground, but when it reaches the city walls it continues above ground. Many architects, including the **Vignola**, tried to collocate underground the whole aqueduct layout, but none of them succeeded.

In **1702**, by order of _Cardinal Giuseppe Renato Imperiali_, the aqueduct project restarted. The works were directed by architect _Filippo Barigioni_ with _Master Giuseppe Bernascone_’s assistance.

When the aqueduct was completed, **a fountain designed by Barigioni** was built in the colonnade in front of the City Hall, as memento of the accomplished venture.

Although almost three hundreds years have passed, **this aqueduct keeps supplying water to the public fountains of Nepi**.
