The church stands **next to Saint Biagio’s Church**. According to ancient documents it existed already in the **10th century**. Until the second half of the 19th century different building steps succeded over times, when the original structure completely changed.

The story of this building was always connected with the one of the near Saint Biagio Church. Both buildings originated from an **old female Benedictine Monastery** which was there already in the 10th century and until the 16th century.

The progressive elevation of the floor of the square in front of the churches, which led to the closure of the entrance of the Saint Biagio Church, meant that from the Renaissance period the two buildings, connected by internal passages, were to constitute a **single body with entrance from the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie**.

Only after the **restoration of Saint Biagio Church**, completed in **2002**, the separation between the two structures was partially restored.

La chiesa di Santa Maria o _**Madonna delle Grazie**_ internamente si presenta ad un’**unica aula voltata con pareti spoglie**, decorate da **stuccature della fine del XIX secolo**. Il presbiterio è protetto da una cancellata, dietro la quale sulla parete di fondo vi è un affresco raffigurante la _**Vergine con i santi Nicola e Egidio**_. Un bel cippo funerario di età romana funge da acquasantiera.

The church of Santa Maria delle Grazie or _**Madonna delle Grazie**_ internally presents itself in a **single vaulted room with bare walls**, decorated with **late 19th century stucco works**. The presbytery is protected by a gate, behind which on the back wall there is a fresco depicting the _**Virgin with Saints Nicholas and Egidio**_. A beautiful Roman funerary memorial stone serves as a stoup.
