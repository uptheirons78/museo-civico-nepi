The church is **connected to the Monastery of Saint Bernardo** which occupies the eastern end of the tufaceous spur on which the inhabited center of Nepi stands. In the **15th century** a church dedicated to _San Pancrazio_ was intended to be built on the site. Subsequently, the building passed to host the _**Confraternity of Madonna dell'Immagine**_.

Works began around the year **1560** and ended in **1616**. The foundation of the monastery dates back, however, to 1618, with the arrival of **Cistercian nuns** from the important monastery of Saint Susanna in Rome.

The **cloistered monastic community** remained active until the beginning of the 21th century, when the last religious returned to their main monastery in Rome.

The church of San Bernardo was built with **a single hall, two altars for each side and a chapel with a vaulted ceiling**. The ceiling is coffered.

One of the altars on the left hosts the heavily reworked fresco of the _** Madonna of the Image**_ also called _Madonna dei Somarari_. This fresco originally must have belonged to the church of Madonna dellâ€™Immagine demolished in 1542.
