The church was built in **1540** after the demolition of the church with the same name that stood over the catacombs.

The initial project by _**Antonio da San Gallo Il Giovane**_ planned a huge rectangular building with three naves preceded by a colonnade. The tribune was supposed to be octagonal with a temple in its center. Works started in **1543** and they were then suspended after the departure of Pier Luigi Farnese from Nepi in 1545.

Construction started again only in 1588 and it ended in 1606, realizing a building which was very different from the one foreseen in the initial project. In the second half of the 19th century, by order of the monk ***Vincenzo Pistelli***, the church was renovated. On the sloping roof a dome was built next to the tribune, and the rectangular apse became semicircular.

The one nave inside hosts six chapels and the tribune hosts two chapels.

The construction of the chapels began after the completion of the church in 1606 and continued until 1649, when the beautiful wooden altar commissioned by the **Galeotti's family** was completed.

In 1695, the statue of the Madonna della Vittoria (Our Lady of Victory) was placed inside the altar.

The “Cappella dell’Assunta” (Assunta Chapel) is the only one decorated with frescos. This chapel was commissioned by the Brunetti's family in 1606 and it is now dedicated to the “Madonna dei sette dolori” (Virgin of Seven Sorrows).

Inside it Cecilia Eusebi's relics are kept. **Cecila Eusebi was beatified on the 17th June 2012**.

With the exception of the chapel of Saint Domenico, which is on the right of the major altar, all the other chapels were commissioned by privates.

Saint Domenico chapel was realized by **Dominican priests** in 1632. The portrait decorating this chapel depicts _the seven founders of the Virgin Servant’s Order_.

The church was managed by the Dominicans until 1911 when the Bishop Mons. Doebbing gave it to the **Virgin Servants**.

In 1606 after the church was finished Saint Tolomeo's relics were transferred inside it from the near Church of Saint Andrea and placed together with those of other martyrs under the main altar decorated with a complex structure representing the saint in the year 1664.

Saint Tolomeo sculpture, dressed as a bishop, lying on one of his side was realized by ***Giovanni Francesco De Rossi***.
