description: >-
  LUMEN gives this fascination a photographic home: located at the summit of the region Kronplatz (in South Tyrol), 1,800 square metres are dedicated to mountain photography.
textA: >-
  Spanning four floors LUMEN offers the possibility to experience the history of mountain photography from its beginnings until the present as well as displaying the art of mountain-photographers from all over the world. A scientific approach and entertainment are not contradictions — LUMEN shows historic pictures and digital innovations, exciting temporary and special exhibitions as well as spectacular productions.

  The curated program stands out due to its interdisciplinary character: alpinism, tourism, politics, spirituality and history — the subject mountains is examined from different perspectives.
textC: >-
  Even the location itself is special: in the heart of the Dolomites — the „most beautiful natural architecture in the world“ (Le Corbusier) – the building of the former mountain station of the ‚Kronplatz‘- funicular shines resplendent in its modern look at 2.265 m.

  Thus LUMEN makes a great contribution to profiting from the region’s potential all year round and adds value to all of its surroundings. With the trinity of exhibition - event space - alpine cuisine LUMEN erects a monument in the honour of mountain photography — multifaceted and extraordinary, just like the mountains themselves.
